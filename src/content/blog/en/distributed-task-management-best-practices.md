Managing tasks across multiple machines requires careful planning and best practices. Learn how to optimize your workflow with Rediacc.

## Priority Management

### Understanding Priorities

Rediacc uses a 5-level priority system (1 = highest, 5 = lowest). Use priorities strategically:

- **Priority 1**: Critical tasks that must run immediately (database backups, emergency fixes)
- **Priority 2**: Important tasks with time sensitivity (deployments, security patches)
- **Priority 3**: Standard tasks (regular syncs, reports)
- **Priority 4**: Background tasks (cleanup, maintenance)
- **Priority 5**: Low-priority tasks (archives, logs)

### Example

```bash
./rediacc create task \
  --machine prod-01 \
  --priority 1 \
  --command "systemctl restart webserver"
```

## Retry Strategies

### Handling Failures

Configure retry behavior based on task type:

```json
{
  "taskId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "retryCount": 3,
  "retryDelay": 30,
  "failureAction": "alert"
}
```

## Team Organization

### Structuring Teams

- Create separate teams for different environments (prod, staging, dev)
- Assign different machines to each team based on access requirements
- Use team vaults to store environment-specific credentials

## Monitoring and Logging

### Best Practices

1. **Monitor queue depth** - Track how many tasks are pending
2. **Set up alerts** - Get notified of failures immediately
3. **Archive logs** - Keep audit trails for compliance
4. **Use structured logging** - Include context in task output

## Security Considerations

Always follow these guidelines:

- Never hardcode credentials in tasks
- Use vault encryption for sensitive data
- Rotate SSH keys regularly
- Limit team member access by role
- Enable audit logging for all operations

## Performance Tips

- Batch small tasks when possible
- Use async operations for non-blocking tasks
- Monitor machine CPU and memory utilization
- Distribute load across multiple machines
