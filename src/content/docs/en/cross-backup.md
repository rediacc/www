> **When Disaster Strikes, Will Your Data Survive? With Rediacc, It Always Does.**

**Note:** This is a **use case example** demonstrating how Rediacc can solve this problem. As a startup, these scenarios represent potential applications rather than completed case studies.

**Crisis Scenario:** After a customer call, services were found to be not working due to a **disk failure**. The remote backup server's last backup was **3 weeks old**, leading to significant data loss.

## The Problem

The company becomes aware of the risks of backing up data **only on the same machine**:
* Hardware failures
* Cyber attacks
* Physical disasters like war, earthquake, fire, flood
* Insufficient protection against data loss

**Search for Solution:**
* It is decided to back up 20 TB of data to **a remote server**
* However, with traditional methods, this backup takes **2 weeks** and occupies **99.99% (depending on update ratio of the total data between snapshots)** of the bandwidth

## Crisis Impact

After a customer call:
* It is noticed that **services are not working**
* A **disk failure** is detected
* When checking the remote backup server, it is understood that **the last backup was taken 3 weeks ago**

**Results:**
* Manual disk recovery attempts **fail**
* Due to 3 weeks of data loss, **customer contracts are canceled**
* The company's **reputation is seriously damaged**

## Rediacc Solution

### 1. **First Backup**
* The first time 20 TB of data is transferred to a remote server, it takes 2 weeks

### 2. **Hourly Cross Backups**
* Every hour, a full backup perception is created, but **only changed data** is transferred

### 3. **Preparation for Disaster Scenarios**
* Data can be backed up even to **intercontinental** servers
* Even if the main machine crashes, data from as recently as 1 hour ago is **activated within minutes**

## Result

**Time Saving:**
* Backup time was reduced from **2 weeks to an average of 4 minutes**
* Data loss risk was reduced to **1 hour**

**Cost Optimization:**
* Bandwidth consumption decreased by **98%**

**Uninterrupted Business Continuity:**
* When the main server crashed, the remote backup was activated in **7 minutes**
