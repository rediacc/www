> **Reduce Environment Setup From Days to Minutes with Smart deduplication Storage Architecture.**

**Note:** This is a **use case example** demonstrating how Rediacc's Infrastructure Automation Platform designed for AI-driven operations can accelerate development. As a startup, these scenarios represent potential applications rather than completed case studies.

## The Problem

Mehmet works as a DevOps engineer in an e-commerce company. The development team needs **production-like environments** for testing, staging, and development. This is because:

**Traditional Environment Challenges:**
* Setting up production-like environments takes **hours or days**
* Developers wait for infrastructure provisioning to complete testing
* Environment inconsistencies lead to "works on my machine" problems

The company struggled with slow development cycles because environment provisioning was a bottleneck. This situation:

* Slowed **development velocity** significantly
* Created dependencies and waiting times in the development pipeline

## Crisis Impact

* Storage costs became **unsustainable** for the IT budget
* Backup windows exceeded available maintenance time
* System performance degraded during backup operations
* Risk of data loss increased due to incomplete backups

## Rediacc Solution

Mehmet discovered Rediacc, and with this system:

### Smart Backup Technology
* **Full backups appear to be taken**, but only **changed data** is physically stored
* For example, if there are **average daily changes of 100 GB** in a 10 TB database, the system **records only those 100 GB**
* Backups work **completely and seamlessly during restoration**, even if stored as a single file

### Key Advantages

**1. Cost Savings**
* Even with **100 GB** daily changes in a 10 TB database, the monthly storage cost is limited to **~3 TB** (it was **~300 TB** with the old system)

**2. Universal Support**
* Rediacc is not limited to SQL Server. It works compatibly with **MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB**, and all other databases
* No need for **separate know-how** for different systems

**3. Time and Resource Efficiency**
* Backup time is reduced from **hours to minutes**
* The load on disk and network resources decreases by 99.99% (depending on update ratio of the total data between snapshots)

## Result

Thanks to Rediacc, the company:
* Reduced storage costs by **99.99% (depending on update ratio of the total data between snapshots)**
* Standardized backup and restore processes
* Met all its needs with **a single solution** for different database systems
