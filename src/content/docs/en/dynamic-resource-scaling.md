> **Is Your Cloud Architecture Rigid? Build With Limitless Flexibility.**

**Note:** This is a **use case example** demonstrating how Rediacc can solve this problem. As a startup, these scenarios represent potential applications rather than completed case studies.

**Crisis Scenario:** AI training times **extended 2-3 times**, causing project delays. Engineers experienced significant productivity loss while waiting for resources, threatening the company's competitive advantage.

## The Problem

The company's software engineers are experiencing performance issues with **on-premise** servers used for **AI model training**:
* During **office hours** (08:00-17:00), server requests reach 99% capacity
* Training requiring high processing power causes the hardware to **be insufficient**

**Search for Solution:**
* Server upgrade cost is **not considered suitable** due to **6-7 hours of daily use**
* Although cloud migration is considered, **data transfer cost** and **synchronization difficulties** are obstacles

## Crisis Impact

* AI training times **extend 2-3 times**, projects are delayed
* Engineers experience **productivity loss** while waiting for resources
* The company faces the risk of **gradually losing its competitive advantage**

## Rediacc Solution

System engineer YÃ¼ksel develops **a hybrid model** with Rediacc:

### 1. **Instant Cloud Migration**
* During office hours, on-premise services are cloned to the cloud **with all data and configurations**
* 100 TB of data is synchronized in 9 minutes by transferring **only the changed parts** thanks to Rediacc

### 2. **Dynamic Scaling**
* Servers in the cloud environment are rented **as much as needed for AI training**
* Processing power can be **increased 10 times** according to demand

### 3. **Night Synchronization**
* At the end of the workday, **all changes in the cloud** are **automatically pulled** to the on-premise environment
* Engineers working at night continue their operations with **up-to-date data**

## Result

**Cost Advantage:**
* By **renting cloud resources hourly**, monthly cost was reduced by **60%**
* The need to upgrade on-premise servers **was eliminated**

**Performance Increase:**
* AI training times were reduced from **8 hours to 1.5 hours**
* Engineer productivity increased by **40%**

**Flexible Working:**
* **Data consistency** between cloud and on-premise environments was ensured seamlessly
* Teams on the night shift **had instant access to up-to-date data**
