> **When The Lights Go Out, Your Business Stays On.**

**Note:** This is a **use case example** demonstrating how Rediacc can solve this problem. As a startup, these scenarios represent potential applications rather than completed case studies.

**Crisis Scenario:** A massive blackout affected Spain and Portugal on April 28, 2025, triggered by a damaged transmission line in France. The power outage brought down critical IT infrastructure, causing major banks and tech companies to lose access to their systems.

## The Problem

The Iberian power grid faced a catastrophic failure cascade:

* A **fire in southwest France** damaged a critical transmission line
* The damage caused **sudden disconnection** of cross-border interconnections
* Spain and Portugal became **electrically isolated** from the European grid

**Impact on Businesses:**
* Data centers across Spain experienced **immediate power loss**
* Backup generators failed to activate in several locations due to control system failures
* Banking systems went offline, preventing transactions across the country

**IT Infrastructure Challenges:**
* **Local backup systems** were ineffective as they were located in the same affected region
* **Emergency recovery procedures** relied on local access to physical servers
* **Business continuity plans** didn't account for nationwide power failure lasting more than 4 hours

## Crisis Impact

The IT service disruption led to:
* **Financial system collapse** with estimated €4.5 billion in transaction delays
* Critical business data becoming inaccessible for 14+ hours
* Major e-commerce platforms experiencing complete shutdown
* Customer service systems failing across multiple industries

## Rediacc Solution

A major Spanish banking group that implemented Rediacc's cross-continental replication solution maintained operations throughout the crisis:

### 1. **Intercontinental Data Mirroring**
* Core banking databases and transaction systems were **continuously replicated** to data centers in the United States
* All customer data and transaction records were synchronized with **less than 3-second delay**

### 2. **Seamless Operational Transition**
* When Spanish servers lost power, traffic was **automatically redirected** to U.S.-based systems
* Customers experienced only a brief 47-second interruption before services resumed

### 3. **Remote Service Continuation**
* Call centers in unaffected countries accessed the replicated systems to maintain customer support
* Mobile banking apps remained functional by connecting to alternative data centers

## Potential Outcome

**Business Continuity:**
* While competitors were offline for 14+ hours, the bank maintained **98% service availability**

**Customer Trust:**
* The bank was the only major financial institution processing transactions during the crisis
* Customer satisfaction increased by 27% in post-crisis surveys

**Financial Protection:**
* The bank avoided approximately €370 million in losses from transaction failures
* No data was lost or corrupted, eliminating costly recovery operations

**Competitive Advantage:**
* The bank onboarded 140,000 new customers in the following month from competitors who failed to maintain service
