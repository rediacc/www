> **Your Legacy Database Is Holding You Back. Break Free Without Breaking It.**

**Note:** This is a **use case example** demonstrating how Rediacc can solve this problem. As a startup, these scenarios represent potential applications rather than completed case studies.

**Crisis Scenario:** Despite scaling servers 10 times with Kubernetes, performance only improved 2 times. Customers complained about slow query times, costs increased without satisfactory results, and reputation was at risk.

## The Problem

The organization's services in the cloud environment were **struggling to respond**. As a solution, the software team:
* Performed **horizontal scaling with Kubernetes** and **increased the number of servers 10 times**
* However, performance improved **only 2 times**

**Bottleneck Detection:**
* It was understood that the source of the problem was a **legacy database that cannot be scaled**
* The database could not work in a distributed manner like in modern architectures

**Dilemma:**
* Migrating to a modern database **could take years** → It required rewriting code, data migration, and testing processes
* Cost and time loss were unacceptable

## Crisis Impact

* Customers are complaining due to **slow query times**
* Server costs are increasing, but **performance is not satisfactory**
* Risk of **reputation loss** increases in a competitive market

## Rediacc Solution

System engineer Yüksel, using Rediacc's cross-backup feature:

### 1. **Real-time Data Replication**
* Changes in the legacy database were transferred to other servers **at 10-15 minute intervals**
* **Only changed data** was synchronized → **Bandwidth consumption reduced by 95%**

### 2. **Query Distribution**
* Read queries were **distributed to multiple machines**
* Write operations were kept **in the main database** to ensure consistency

### 3. **Cost-Free Scaling**
* The legacy system was supported with additional servers **without being changed**
* No need for new hardware acquisition → **Cloud servers were rented hourly** for cost optimization

## Result

**Performance Increase:**
* Query times were reduced from **55 seconds to 7 seconds**
* System capacity increased **8 times**

**Cost Control:**
* Savings from rewriting the legacy system → **Financial resources were preserved**

**Time Gain:**
* The solution was implemented **within 3 weeks**
* Customer complaints were resolved by **99.99% (depending on update ratio of the total data between snapshots)**
