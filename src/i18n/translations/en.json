          "paragraph2": "In 2021, I discovered Docker through NetworkChuck's video. I was shocked by what was possible. I wished I had known about this technology earlier—it could have changed everything.",
          "paragraph3": "But Docker alone didn't solve all my problems. Moving container files between systems was difficult. I faced file ownership compatibility issues, and as data size grew, transfers took longer. Most critically, I had to keep services offline until migration finished, and Docker offered minimal security features."
