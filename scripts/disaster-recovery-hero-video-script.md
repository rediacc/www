# Disaster Recovery Hero Video Script
## Alex Hormozi Style - 60-90 seconds

---

### HOOK (0-5 seconds)
**[Direct to camera, serious tone]**

"Your backups are broken. You just don't know it yet."

---

### PROBLEM SETUP (5-20 seconds)
**[Pattern interrupt, slightly faster pace]**

"Let me ask you something: When was the last time you actually TESTED your backups?

Most companies? Never.

They take backups every single day... and when they need them? Data corruption. Disk failure. Complete system loss.

Here's what nobody tells you:"

---

### THE THREE PROBLEMS (20-50 seconds)
**[Counting on fingers, very direct]**

"**Problem number one**: You're taking backups but never verifying them. Hope is not a strategy.

**Problem number two**: You keep 1 to 3 backups, max. Data from 6 months ago? Gone forever.

**Problem number three**: Full backups of large datasets take WEEKS. You fall behind. You never catch up.

So what happens? You overwrite your old backups. You lose verification. You lose speed.

You lose everything."

---

### THE SHIFT (50-65 seconds)
**[Slight pause, lean in]**

"Here's what works:

**Verified backups** - every single one tested automatically.
**Unlimited history** - months of data, incremental deduplication.
**Incremental speed** - only backup what changed.

No compromises. No hoping. Just backups that actually work."

---

### CALL TO ACTION (65-75 seconds)
**[Direct, authoritative]**

"That's what we built at Rediacc.

Scroll down. See how it works.

Or keep hoping your backups work...

...and find out the hard way when they don't."

---

### END CARD (75-90 seconds)
**[Text on screen]**

**REDIACC**
*Disaster Recovery Done Right*

Verified backups • Unlimited history • Incremental speed

## DELIVERY NOTES

### Tone:
- **Serious but not dramatic** - this is a real problem
- **Confident authority** - we've seen this fail before
- **Direct and punchy** - no filler words
- **Slightly urgent** - without being salesy

### Pacing:
- Hook: **SLOW** - let it land
- Problems: **FASTER** - build momentum
- Shift: **MODERATE** - clarity over speed
- CTA: **DELIBERATE** - make them choose

### Visual Style:
- **Minimal distractions** - focus on speaker
- **Dark background** - matches brand
- **B-roll during problems** - show failed restores, spinning loading icons, overwritten files
- **Clean graphics for solution** - checkmarks, numbers, simple animations

### Key Hormozi Patterns Used:
1. ✅ Pattern interrupt hook
2. ✅ Numbered framework (3 problems)
3. ✅ Rhetorical questions that audience answers "yes" to
4. ✅ Specific examples (not abstract)
5. ✅ Clear contrast (problem vs solution)
6. ✅ No soft language ("kind of", "maybe", "sort of")
7. ✅ Binary choice at end (scroll or keep hoping)
8. ✅ Authority through knowing the problems intimately

## SCRIPT VARIATIONS

### Alternative Hook Options:
- "Your disaster recovery plan is going to fail. Let me show you why."
- "Pop quiz: Can you restore from your backups right now? Most of you can't."
- "I'm going to save you from losing everything. Pay attention."

### Alternative CTA Options:
- "Scroll down if you're tired of hoping. Or don't. Your data, your risk."
- "This is fixable. But only if you actually want to fix it. Scroll down."
- "You have two options: verified backups or hope. Choose wisely."

## PRODUCTION TIPS

1. **Film in 4K** - allows for punch-ins/crops
2. **Use teleprompter** - maintain eye contact
3. **Multiple takes** - punch varies each time
4. **B-roll list**:
   - Failed backup restore screens
   - Loading/progress bars at 99%
   - Files being deleted/overwritten
   - Calendar showing months/years
   - Server racks/data centers
   - Checkmarks appearing
   - Numbers counting up (storage saved)

5. **Sound design**:
   - Subtle tension music during problems
   - Silence before the shift
   - Confident music during solution
   - Hard cut to silence at CTA

6. **Graphics**:
   - Number badges (1, 2, 3) during problems
   - Simple checkmarks for solutions
   - Progress indicators
   - Text overlays for emphasis

---

## WHY THIS WORKS

**Hormozi's formula applied:**
1. **Grab attention** - provocative hook
2. **Agitate problems** - they already have these
3. **Show mechanism** - what's actually broken
4. **Present solution** - specific, not vague
5. **Remove risk** - "see how it works" vs "buy now"
6. **Force decision** - binary choice creates action

The script creates **self-liquidating value** - even if they don't click, they learned something valuable about their backup strategy.
